_an interactive, AI-powered children‚Äôs story generator_


## Introduction

_Storytime_ is an AI-aided children‚Äôs story generator designed in dialogue contemporary debates about "centering the human" and concerns regarding the "dearth of the author" in AI-driven creative writing (Kreminski, 2024). Drawing on research in digital humanism and educational interactive digital narratives (IDN), Storytime leverages Large Language Model (LLM) technology to enable users to generate novel combinations of characters, places, and challenges‚Äîfor example, having their favorite characters face problems of the user's choosing‚Äîwhile emphasizing human agency, creativity, and (very basic) narrative structure (Fisher, 2023; Baumann & Bergeron, 1993). The project is designed as a proof-of-concept in framing LLM-based story generation, in this case of children's stories, as a co-creative and interactive endeavor.

Inspired by the "Loose Ends" project (Kreminski et al., 2022), _Storytime_ is both a simplified, user-facing narrative platform and, more abstractly, an exploration of AI‚Äôs limitations and its potential to augment‚Äînot displace‚Äîhuman initiative in story construction. This is situated within current scholarship advocating a digital humanist perspective, ensuring technology scales, rather than substitutes, authentic human creativity (Fisher, 2023), as well as research on pedagogical IDNs and the recognized power of story mapping and narrative frameworks in fostering children‚Äôs narrative comprehension, creativity, and agency (Nunes da Concei√ß√£o Duarte Pinheiro & Ciancia, 2024; Baumann & Bergeron, 1993).


## Methodology

Recognizing concerns surrounding the automation of authorship and the risk of LLM-facilitated narrative homogenization, the system was designed to foreground human inputs at critical creative points. Users are invited to define, step-by-step, the story's characters, setting, challenge, and resolution.

The user experience is intentionally scaffolded, taking cues from classroom-proven story-mapping strategies. Children (or co-users) are prompted to specify the ‚Äúwho,‚Äù ‚Äúwhere,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat problem,‚Äù and ‚Äúhow it is resolved‚Äù‚Äîcomponents demonstrated to enhance comprehension and recall of central story elements in early readers (Baumann & Bergeron, 1993). This preserves a balance between creative freedom and structural guidance, encouraging repeated, motivated engagement while fostering deeper understanding of narrative form.

Each narrative produced within _Storytime_ is a unique reflection of the distinct inputs provided by the user. Rather than surrendering story direction  to AI, users can customize or swap story elements, experiment with different resolutions, and see immediate variations on their ideas. The platform supports cyclic exploration, presenting narrative generation as a process of collaboration between human imagination and machine assistance, rather than a passively consumed output.

_Storytime_ is built in accordance with ethical and pedagogical best practices. It prioritizes user privacy, explicitly communicates its use of AI, and neither stores nor exploits creative content beyond the user‚Äôs session. The design encourages continuous, active participation, and critical thinking. Repeated use, even with identical story elements, produces unique stories, fostering both curiosity about language and the inner workings of generative AI, and an appreciation of narrative diversity itself.


## The Project

Storytime is realized as a web-based story generator that invites children and other users to co-create original tales by making a series of creative choices. After entering a secure API key, users are prompted to specify two characters‚Äîfictional characters from pop-culture, figures from history, or those of the user's creation. They then select a setting, choosing or describing any place they can think of. Next, the system asks them to choose a type of central problem: this might be a lost item, an interpersonal conflict, or any other issue they care to invent. For the problem, users can provide their own ideas or use suggested prompts to spark inspiration.

After setting up these 'narrative ingredients', users have the option to craft their own story resolution or explore AI-generated suggestions, picking or editing whichever resonates most. Finally, with a single click, Storytime generates a complete story, showcasing the chosen characters as they navigate the chosen challenge in the designated setting, resolving their problem in unique ways. Each component of the story‚Äîcharacters, emotions, resolutions‚Äîremains interactive, and children can experiment with swaps or new combinations at any time, producing countless story variations.

While the LLM is responsible for transforming structured input into fluent, imaginative narrative, it does so only after users have made a series of meaning-rich decisions, which can be changed and re-made for the story to be re-made as well. By this framework, generative AI is seen as a _process_ more than as a _product_; not a replacement for human authorship but as a new way to interact with language. The project structures the creative process to ensure that agency never shifts away from the human; Storytime emphasizes that the story‚Äôs arc, conflicts, and solutions are ultimately shaped by the choices and preferences of its human author.

The system encourages reflective play and collaborative exploration, making it a powerful, accessible tool for families, classrooms, or individual young storytellers. By foregrounding narrative structure and iterative decision-making, Storytime helps participants develop deeper narrative comprehension and self-expression, all while exploring the creative capabilities‚Äîand limitations‚Äîof contemporary AI.


## Conclusion

The Storytime project exemplifies how AI can be used not as a replacement for human creativity, but as a scaffold, guide, and partner in the creative process. By intentionally centering the child or co-user as the active author, Storytime resists trends toward automated, authorless generation that can result in ‚Äúsoulless‚Äù or homogenized output. Instead, it leverages the strengths of LLMs‚Äîinfinite recombination and rapid feedback‚Äîwhile preserving and strengthening the expressive intent and narrative agency of its users.

Fundamentally, Storytime frames AI-generated text _as_ AI-generated, and as a means to further creative exploration. Human interaction is central to the framework of this project, which holds user input at its core‚Äînot designed as a one-way tool to generate a story for outside reproduction, but as a continual process of modification and re-generation, by which users may learn the ins and outs of generative AI‚Äîincluding its limitations. Storytime demonstrates how AI-powered systems for children‚Äôs storytelling can be intentionally designed to center human agency, authorial presence, and narrative comprehension, directly addressing criticisms around AI-induced creative homogenization and the diminishing role of the human author (Kreminski, 2024; Fisher, 2023). By integrating best practices from educational research on story mapping and interactive narratives (Baumann & Bergeron, 1993), Storytime not only enables children to enjoy the unique generative affordances of LLMs, but‚Äîcrucially‚Äîframes the technology as a creativity support tool, not a substitute for the human storyteller.

This human-centric, participatory approach holds promise for both democratizing creativity and deepening children‚Äôs understanding of narrative structure, engagement, and self-expression (Nunes da Concei√ß√£o Duarte Pinheiro & Ciancia, 2024; Baumann & Bergeron, 1993). Storytime engages in dialogue raising ongoing questions for research and design regarding how to best support learning, creativity, and ethical authorship in the age of generative AI.
